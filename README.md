# ISMIR 2016

Archive of the ISMIR 2016 conference website.

## Contributing

This repository contains a static archive of an ISMIR conference website. Changes to this website should be primarily for the maintenance and upkeep of hyperlinks on the web and any drift in web technologies.

To respect GitHub's file size limits on repositories, PDFs (publications, proceedings) and large multimedia objects are hosted elsewhere (Zenodo, YouTube, etc). Please **do not** add files that are 10MB or larger to this repository.

If you notice something to be in error, you are encouraged to create a pull request (ideal!) or simply create an issue.


## Development

If testing locally, note that currently the resources subdir is root-referenced for 
GitHub pages (`/ismir2016/resources`, and `\/ismir2016\/resources` for in-line JS).

Eventually, when the ismir2016.ismir.net subdomain is used, the `ismir2016` prefix in
the above URLs can be removed.
